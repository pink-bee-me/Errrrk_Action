                      how well you can "Get To Know" someone by reading about them on a web page. Maybe it's not too far-fetched to presume that it
                       could be possible, even probable, to learn a few things and get a pretty good read on some fundamental aspects of an individual's
                        personality. Tidbits, morsels, whatever you want to call them - I'm sharing "THEM" with YOU. I am committed to achieving this objective.
