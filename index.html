<!--Notice: Yes, indeed, this is a notice....  I’m supposed to tell you all about myself...Did I mention that as a child,  I was told, “Less is more, LaurieSue...Less is more.” That was the polite way of saying that I talked too much, and it also effectively stifled my social participation.  Now, I just write too much,  especially in situations that cause me to feel somewhat uncomfortable.  With that being said,  this sort of thing is considered usual and customary behavior, so I’ll give it a go.  Do you think it is possible to “Get To Know” someone through an introduction on a web page?  Maybe it’s not too far-fetched to presume it could be possible,... even probable.  You might get a pretty good read on some fundamental aspects of an individual’s personality.  I guess it seems rational to believe that one could learn at least a  few things about someone in this way.  So there, it’s decided... These little tidbits or morsels of personal insight - whatever you wish to call them - I will surrender and share some of “THESE” with you.  I am fully committed to this objective with high hopes that something you find within sparks your interest, triggering your curious nature and, therefore,  motivating you to reach out to continue this conversation.  Thank you for this opportunity.  Now that I have successfully increased our discomfort level, disregard this so-called “Notice” and proceed.
Critical thinking is a Skill, an Art Form, and the foundation of great code.
Artists use many different styles to express themselves.  Code is the medium through which computer programmers communicate their ideas and bring their vision to life. 

Code is a creation brought to life by the artist...
the computer programmer.

 Code can dazzle you with its sparkle and shine like a polished diamond adorned with mighty and magical frameworks and APIs, or it can demand respect like a brilliant masterpiece filled with design patterns and strategically crafted databases or show up with the innocence and charm of a child expressed through the simplest of doodles... Code may resemble all of the above or be anything in between.  That’s the beauty of it!

The adventures, the discoveries, the trials and tribulations, the obstacles to overcome, and the never-ending hunt for buried treasure... These are the quests that lure us into the incredible and unpredictable world of programming ... and they continue to be a great source of motivation and the reason I wake up excited to tackle whatever happens to come my way!  I can’t wait to see what unexpected twists and turns my path will take as I step up and welcome the challenges that each new day brings...


And now a word from our sponsor...
The Almost Famous Co.

 “Yes, I say, ’tis undoubtedly true that the land of Software Development and  Information Technology are magical domains in which adventure and discovery are the norm... For ye will see that there is always something new to learn and uncharted territories to explore just beyond the horizon !!!”

-an unnamed distant relative of William Shakespeare
(specific, but undeniably unverified)

...These words of wisdom, taken from The Almost Famous Co. family photo album, and cherish them.  We humbly express our gratitude to all you fine folks visiting here today,... Enjoy this timeless treasure, a gift from our family to yours!

This message has been brought to you by the good people at The Almost Famous Co.:

“Here at The Almost Famous Co., we firmly believe that anyone and everyone,...anywhere and everywhere, is undeniably, more than likely, almost famous.  For one need not look too far down the ancestral trail to find evidence that someone,...somewhere, did something - be it good or bad - That Almost Made Them Famous!

Our sole purpose is to spread the word, making more people aware of just how Almost Famous they, quite possibly, may actually be.  That being said,  may they rest assured and take comfort in the possibility of certainty this knowledge provides...”

... and now back to our regularly scheduled program.

Trained as a Full-Stack Developer at
The Tech Academy Software Engineering Boot Camp,
I gained valuable experience working with the following programming languages and software development tools: C#, JavaScript, ASP.NET, Object-Oriented Program (OOP), MVC, Entity Framework, SQL, Databases, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and more.
I have always enjoyed taking things apart to see how they work. I love taking something that is broken and making it work even better than before.  I like playing detective, gathering information, looking for hidden clues, deciphering secret codes, and solving mysteries. I believe that difficult situations and less-than-perfect circumstances make arriving at a successful outcome even more satisfying and fulfilling, and there are no negatives, only challenges, lessons, and opportunities.

 I take pride in my work.  I like to smile and laugh often, and I do just that!  I enjoy learning new things and increasing my skill level.  There is always room to get better at the things you already know.  I like to push myself out of my comfort zone and face my fears.  This is the only way to move forward in life.  Well,.. that’s enough philosophical insight for one girl’s profile website.  You have reached the end.  Mission Accomplished!

My name is...
LaurieSue Peterson.

Now, let’s put our heads together and create extraordinary solutions!-->
