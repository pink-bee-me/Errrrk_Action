Current Issues:
    - .active not functioning properly to make navbar links have an "active" state
    - .show-on-scroll not functioning properly (javascript to make span elements go from transparent to not transparent as the elements scroll into view) 
    - the website is not responsive... ugh!!!

State of Affairs:
    - working on implementing remedies for all issues listed above
